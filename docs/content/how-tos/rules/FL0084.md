# EnsureTailCallDiagnosticsInRecursiveFunctions (FL0084)

*Introduced in `0.23.8`*

## Cause

Recursive function is not marked as tail-recursive using `[<TailCall>]` attribute.

## Rationale

Tail-recursive functions have no risk of stack overflow and perform better.
Adding `[<TailCall>]` attribute to recursive function makes compiler check that it's indeed tail-recursive and give warning otherwise.
`<WarningsAsErrors>FS3569</WarningsAsErrors>` property in project file will make compiler treat this as warning as error.
Requires .NET 8 or later.

## How To Fix

Add `[<TailCall>]` attribute to your function.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "ensureTailCallDiagnosticsInRecursiveFunctions": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
